--Usability
    Usability survey -note any rough edges in common tools.
    --USABILITY
    -truss support
    -document how to use a debugger with Castor
    -document rr_assert/rr_printf

    
--Testing
  -look into using libc test suite to test castor
  -unit tests:
  -more complicated pthread tests
  -corner cases for pthread cond variables.
  -look into using regression test suite to test castor tools/

--Completeness
    -stuff in SYSCALLS_TODO, and PTHREAD_TODO
    -migrate over to using code generation stuff for all eligible calls.

--CLEANUP
    -indentation/spacing is inconsistent.

--FIX
    -fdInfo not threadsafe.
    -currently we don't correctly implement file locking to do this we need to
        -track the inode associated with an fd with fstat on open
        -inherit this through dup/dup2/fcntl in fdinfo.
        -track which inodes are locked through an efficient hash table in
            the shared memory segment.
        -correctly log the order of lock events on inodes through fcntl/flock
            using this.
    -ensure that Castor symbols are either static or prefixed with __rr_ to prevent namespace pollution.

--Other features:
    -Add check to ensure that binary has been compiled with Castor pass.
