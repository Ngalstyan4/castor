BUGS
    -non-deterministic failures with thread_cond_signal unit test.
    -build only works reiability with: scons -c; scons ; scons testbench -- shouldn't need this.

    -getrlimit/setrlimit unit tests pass if we don't interpose on the calls, probably others do too.
    - several unit tests output rediction looks
      like its failing when run by the test harness 
      -- pipe and udp are example.
    - exit() doesnt flush io buffers (breaks file redirection and some builds)
    - strerror_r (used in PERROR debug macro) calls stat internally
    - gethostbyname calls _pthread_once directly
    - events_posix semaphor stuff not implemented, needed by Python.
	- Python: "import time" causes core dump, possibly related to semaphore stuff
    - semaphore_producer_consumer test has an event divergence, possibly related to exit bug
    - -lthr works sometime and -lpthread does not, e.g. simple-udp test.
    - valgrind is hanging on replay, would be good to have this working so we can
      catch bugs in Castor with it.
    -sysV shm resource leaks are super annoying, how can we make this more usable so
    users don't have to constantly be cleaning up leaked resources.
