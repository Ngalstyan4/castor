RECORD(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              RECORD(1)

NAME
     record â€“ record program execution.

SYNOPSIS
     record [-ph] [-o file] [-e entries] [-c cores] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
     The record utility is part of the Castor record/replay system. It records
     program execution to a log, which can later be replayed with the
     replay(1) utility. To do this efficiently, it records only non-
     deterministic inputs e.g. the result of system calls such as getpid(2),
     gettimeofday(2), read(2), recv(2), etc. to a log file.  It does this
     through a combination of compile time instrumentation using clang(1) and
     shared library interposition.


OPTIONS

  -o [file]     Log file name, default name is default.rr

  -h            Help

  -r [size]     Size of shared region memory region used to communicate between record
		process and application processes.

  -e [entries]  Number of entries per thread

  -c [cores]    Maximum number of application cores

  -p            Pin threads

  -t            Stops child process on creation for attaching a debugger in record mode

EXIT STATUS
  If an error occurs record exits 1, otherwise, it exists with whatever the
  exit status of the program being recorded.

COMPATIBILITY
    Castor only targets FreeBSD Release 1.2 Stable and beyond.

LIMITATIONS
    Castor may not be able to replay applications that make system calls directly or that
    don't build with the castor compiler pass.
