.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrrlog\fP utility is part of the Castor record/replay system. It displays
.TP
.B
the contents of a log which has been recorded using the \fBrecord\fP(1) utility.
and ends with a summary.
.SH LOG FORMAT
The log is a sorted collection of entries with the following fields which
are displayed in order:
.PP
"Event #", "Thread #", "Event", "Object ID", "Value[0] - Value[4]"
.PP
These fields denote the following:
.PP
Event # - order event was recorded/will be replayed.
.PP
Thread # - threadid of thread which logged the event.
.PP
Event - name of event that generated the log entry: the name will either
be of a system call e.g. FORK, WAIT, GETPID. Argument data for a system
call: DATA, A thread library call: e.g. MUTEX_INIT, COND_INIT, SPIN_LOCK.
or a compiler primitive: ATOMIC_LOAD, INLINE_ASM. Or additional castor
meta-data e.g. LOCKED_EVENT
.PP
Object ID - stores the object a system call is operating on e.g. the file
descriptor # for \fBread\fP(2) or the socket descriptor # for \fBsendmsg\fP(2).
.PP
VALUE[0-4] - contents of this field is system call dependant. In general
VALUE[0] stores the result of a system call, VALUE[1] stores the value of
errno if result < 0. Value fields can also be used to store the side
effects of system calls e.g. that are small enough to be stored with the
event and don't require seperate data records.
.PP
A summary of the event totals is output after the log.
