    -improve test framework with timeouts, error handling, etc. similar to unit and per.
    -put bugs into bug tracker
    -finish read me to include integration tests

Unit tests
    -put bugs into bug tracker

System call survey
    -improve scripts/put in coding covention/etc. to make it easy to see what
     has/has not been implemented.

    -implement remaining system calls which are applicable to normal apps.

Usability survey

    -note any rough edges in common tools and add to bug tracker

Documentation
    -man pages for record.1, replay.1, rrlog.1
    -add simple example app and add to README


--UNIT TESTS TO ADD

  -more complicated pthread tests
    -corner cases for pthread cond variables.

--SYSTEM CALLS TO ADD
pipe2
faccessat
sendfile
look at which pthread stuff hasn't been implemented.


--CLEANUP

--FIX

-fdInfo not threadsafe.

-currently we don't correctly implement file locking to do this we need to
    -track the inode associated with an fd with fstat on open
    -inherit this through dup/dup2/fcntl in fdinfo.
    -track which inodes are locked through an efficient hash table in
     the shared memory segment.
    -correctly log the order of lock events on inodes through fcntl/flock
    using this.


-ensure that Castor symbols are either static or prefixed with __rr_ to prevent
 namespace pollution.

-gethostbyname calls _pthread_once directly
    
--Other


--BUGS
    -flaky unit tests (network-basic, thread-once, thread-cond-broadcast)
    - -lthr works sometime and -lpthread does not, e.g. simple-udp test.
    - output from record when exec fails on program start is pretty gross
      for non-Castor developer humans.
