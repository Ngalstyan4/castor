--CLEANUP

--FIX

-fdInfo not threadsafe.

-currently we don't correctly implement file locking to do this we need to
    -track the inode associated with an fd with fstat on open
    -inherit this through dup/dup2/fcntl in fdinfo.
    -track which inodes are locked through an efficient hash table in
     the shared memory segment.
    -correctly log the order of lock events on inodes through fcntl/flock
    using this.


-ensure that Castor symbols are either static or prefixed with __rr_ to prevent
 namespace pollution.

--Other


--BUGS
    -flaky unit tests (pthread_cond_broadcast, udp)
    - -lthr works sometime and -lpthread does not, e.g. simple-udp test.
    - output from record when exec fails on program start is pretty gross
      for non-Castor developer humans.
