-finish pending stuff in syscall list
-finish parsing all SAL annotations.
-finish code gen for all SAL annotations.

-change @success to _Success_(expr) to conform with SAL, document 
    -- make sure you understand this annotaiton
    -- translate appropriately
-add success annotations for every function we support to ensure appropriate errno handling.
-fix errno handling, use success to only check/set errno when needed --- when this is, 
can we assume that any function for whome result != -1 is success will set errno on failure?

-go through SYSCALL_TODO, add more unsupported calls, write some unit tests.
-change code to correctly reference events_gen.h in the variant build directory.

-optimize recording of socketlen_t parameters by storing them as values.
-consider what to do with unsupported calls.
