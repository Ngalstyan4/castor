-add flags to support parameters in autogenerate_syscalls.
    -e.g. quirky named calls  SYS___.

-purge anything else possible from core runtime.

-rename to autogen.

-change code to correctly reference events_gen.h in the variant build directory.

-optimize recording of socketlen_t parameters by storing them as values, and other scalar types (e.g. getdirentries), anything that is an _Out_parameter and scalar type, if it
is an aggregate type, check the size and if small enough, shove it into values.

-teach gen_sal to log iovec's so we can support preadv/readv.

-Write comment block for differnt system call lists
    -come up with a theory of passthrough, document it, make sure all calls in
    passthrough conform to this theory -- same thing with unsupported.

-update README.md
