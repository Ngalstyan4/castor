-move to using sycalls.master with SAL annotations from freebsd.
    -add support for type translations (caddr_t, etc.)
    -try to infer const'ness from SAL annotations.

-finish pending stuff in syscall list
-finish parsing all SAL annotations.
-finish code gen for all SAL annotations.

#just add comment about this..
-fix errno handling, use success to only check/set errno when needed --- when this is,
can we assume that any function for whome result != -1 is success will set errno on failure?

-go through SYSCALL_TODO, add more unsupported calls, write some unit tests.
-change code to correctly reference events_gen.h in the variant build directory.

-optimize recording of socketlen_t parameters by storing them as values.
-consider what to do with unsupported calls.
