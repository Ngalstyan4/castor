-fix errno handling, use success to only check/set errno when needed --- when this is,
can we assume that any function for whome result != -1 is success will set errno on failure?
base this on SAL annotations, add _Success_ annotations (or something else) for calls
that don't return -1 on error.

-add flags to support parameters in autogenerate_syscalls.
    -e.g. quirky named calls  SYS___.
    -use return value as logging size. (is there SAL for this.)

-rename to autogen.

-change code to correctly reference events_gen.h in the variant build directory.

-optimize recording of calls e.g. (read, kevent, ...) where we should only log
(result) number of entries for a given pointer _Out_ parameter.

-optimize recording of socketlen_t parameters by storing them as values, and other scalar types (e.g. getdirentries), anything that is an _Out_parameter and scalar type, if it
is an aggregate type, check the size and if small enough, shove it into values.

-consider what to do with unsupported calls.

-improve testing.

-teach gen_sal to log iovec's so we can support preadv/readv.

-come up with a theory of passthrough, document it, make sure all calls in passthrough
conform to this theory -- same thing with unsupported.

-update README.md
