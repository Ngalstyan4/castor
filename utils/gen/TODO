-add flags to support parameters in autogenerate_syscalls.
    -e.g. quirky named calls  SYS___.
    -use return value as logging size.

-finish pending stuff in syscall list - merge into above stuff

-push kevent annotation change for nevents/eventlist to syscalls.master.

-autogenerate unsupported syscall list from handler spec.
    -rename autogenerate_syscalls, to supported_syscalls
    -add list of pass_through calls
    -unsupported calls = all_calls - pass_through - supported

-rename handlers_* to syscalls_* to reflect seperation of parser.

-check completeness/correctness of SAL handling
    -finish parsing all SAL annotations.
    -finish code gen for all SAL annotations.

-rename to autogen.

#just add comment about this..
-fix errno handling, use success to only check/set errno when needed --- when this is,
can we assume that any function for whome result != -1 is success will set errno on failure?

-go through SYSCALL_TODO, add more unsupported calls, write some unit tests.
-change code to correctly reference events_gen.h in the variant build directory.

-optimize recording of calls e.g. (read, kevent, ...) where we should only log (result) number of
entries for a given pointer _Out_ parameter.

-optimize recording of socketlen_t parameters by storing them as values, and other
scalar types (e.g. getdirentries)

-consider what to do with unsupported calls.

-improve testing.
