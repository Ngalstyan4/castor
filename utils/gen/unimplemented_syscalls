;some type signature generation bug.

;Just not done, also select and poll can probably be autogenerated now.
pselect
ppoll

;needs to be added to core runtime.

;Also not done, probably needs to be in core runtime for output divergence checking.

;XXX not sure what the issue is
__cap_rights_get
getpagesize

;XXX type signature issues
sysarch

;XXXmissing syscall numbers in syscall.h -- only there to support legacy binaries
;support it in core by calling libc versions.

;similar, now implements through sysctl

;ditto not sure where the syscall entry is, probably uses sysctl underneath.
